# ðŸŽµ Music Downloader

Music Downloader is a Python application that automates:
- Parsing album/song metadata from Apple Music, YouTube, and Wikipedia
- Downloading audio tracks from YouTube
- Tagging MP3s with proper metadata
- Running either as a CLI tool or a Tkinter GUI

The goal is to make building a local, well-tagged music library easy for both developers and non-technical users.
